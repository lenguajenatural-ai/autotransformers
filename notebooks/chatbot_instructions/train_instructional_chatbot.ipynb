This dataset provides a rich collection of conversational and instructional interactions in Spanish, making it an ideal resource for developing chatbots capable of understanding and executing specific instructions. We'll leverage the `autotransformers` library to streamline the training process, applying advanced techniques such as LoRA and quantization for efficient model adaptation and performance. Whether you're looking to enhance an existing chatbot or build a new one from scratch, this guide will equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to succeed."

    "## Importing Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, it's essential to import the necessary libraries that will be used throughout the tutorial. These libraries provide the foundational tools required for loading datasets, configuring models, and training. Below is a brief overview of each import and its role in our project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from autotransformers import AutoTrainer, DatasetConfig, ModelConfig`: Imports the `AutoTrainer` class for orchestrating the training process, and `DatasetConfig` and `ModelConfig` for configuring the dataset and model parameters, respectively, within the `autotransformers` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from autotransformers.llm_templates import QLoraWrapperModelInit, modify_tokenizer, qlora_config, SavePeftModelCallback`: These imports from the `autotransformers` library's large language model (LLM) templates module include utilities for initializing models with LoRA wrappers, modifying tokenizers to fit our task, configuring quantization (QLoRA), and implementing a callback to save PEFT (Post-training Efficiency Fine-tuning) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from functools import partial`: The `partial` function from the `functools` module is used to partially apply functions, allowing us to pre-specify some arguments of a function, which is particularly useful for customizing our tokenizer modification function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from peft import LoraConfig`: Imports the `LoraConfig` class from the `peft` library, which is used to specify configurations for LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), an efficient method for adapting pre-trained models to new tasks with minimal computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from datasets import load_dataset`: From the `datasets` library, we import the `load_dataset` function, which is used to load and preprocess data from a wide range of datasets available in the Hugging Face Datasets repository, including our target dataset `somos-clean-alpaca-es`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure all these libraries are installed in your environment before proceeding with the tutorial.\n"

    "## Creating the Chat Template\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **User Messages**: Wrapped with `<user>` tags to clearly indicate messages from the user. These are the instructions or queries directed at the chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Messages**: Enclosed within `<system>` tags, followed by line breaks for readability. These messages might include system-generated instructions or context that guides the chatbot's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assistant Responses**: Placed between the conversation, after `</user>` tags and marked with `</assistant>` tags at the end, along with the end-of-sentence (EOS) token. These are the chatbot's replies or actions taken in response to the user's message, at each utterance or intervention in the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Data**: Marked with `<input>` tags to distinguish any additional input or contextual information provided to the chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured format is crucial for the model to understand the different components of a conversation, enabling it to generate appropriate responses based on the role of each message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a conversation will start with the system message, then have an input containing additional context for the assistant, and then turns of user-assistant, which can be one or more."

    "## Dataset Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset preparation phase is crucial for structuring the data in a way that's conducive to training a chatbot. We first load the dataset from the hub and then utilize a custom function, `process_alpaca`, to transform each sample from the `somos-clean-alpaca` dataset into a format that mirrors a real conversation flow involving a system message, user input, and assistant response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `process_alpaca` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "`process_alpaca` takes a dictionary representing a single dataset sample and restructures it by categorizing and ordering messages based on their role in a conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It starts by adding a **system message** that sets the context for the chatbot as an assistant designed to follow user instructions.\n",
    "- If present, **input data** is added next to provide additional context or information needed to fulfill the user's request.\n",
    "- The **user's instruction** is then added, followed by the **assistant's output**, which is the response to the user's request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This restructuring results in a `messages` list within the sample dictionary, containing all conversation elements in their logical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying the Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply this transformation across the entire dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use the `.map` method with `process_alpaca` as the mapping function, setting `batched=False` to process samples individually and `num_proc=4` to parallelize the operation, enhancing efficiency.\n",
    "- Columns not part of the `messages` structure are removed to streamline the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the dataset is split into training and test sets with a 20% test size, ensuring that we can evaluate our chatbot's performance on unseen data. This split is achieved using the `train_test_split` method, providing a solid foundation for training and validating the chatbot model.\n"

    "- **Batch sizes** for both training and evaluation are set to 1, indicating that samples are processed individually. This can be particularly useful for large models or when GPU memory is limited.\n",

    "- A **warmup ratio** of 0.03 gradually increases the learning rate at the beginning of training to prevent the model from converging too quickly to a suboptimal solution.\n",
    "- **Learning rate**, **weight decay**, and other optimization settings are carefully chosen to balance model learning speed and quality.\n",
